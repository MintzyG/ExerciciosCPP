#  Calculadora-de-Algebra
this is a coding project to develop my coding skills and algebra skills at the same time. The goal of this project is to create a solver for most of algebra's problems like
- Basic matrix operations:
  - Sum/Subtraction
  - Multiplication/Division
  - Determinant
  - Transposition
- Advanced matrix operations
  - Linear Systems
  - Cramer's rule
  - Inverse
  - Laplace
